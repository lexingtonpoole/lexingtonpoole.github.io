## About Me
My name is Lexington Poole. I am 20-years-old and from the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. I am a junior at Lehigh University.

I declared a double major in Cognitive Science and Journalism the spring semester of my sophomore year. I am on Lehigh's softball team. In my freetime I make college lifestyle videos on YouTube.
